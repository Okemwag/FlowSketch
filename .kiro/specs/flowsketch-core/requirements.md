# Requirements Document

## Introduction

FlowSketch is an AI-powered tool that automates the transformation of unstructured requirements (Slack messages, meeting notes, brainstorming docs) into synchronized diagrams and specifications. The system addresses the common pain points of manual translation being slow, error-prone, and difficult to maintain when requirements change. FlowSketch provides a live, bidirectional sync between visual diagrams and textual specifications, enabling teams to work with their preferred format while maintaining consistency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to paste unstructured text and automatically generate a visual diagram, so that I can quickly transform meeting notes into clear visual representations without manual diagramming work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user pastes unstructured text into the input field THEN the system SHALL parse the text and extract entities, relationships, and workflow steps
2. WHEN the system processes the input text THEN it SHALL automatically determine the most appropriate diagram type (flowchart, ERD, sequence diagram, or other)
3. WHEN the diagram is generated THEN the system SHALL provide auto-layout with smooth zoom and pan functionality
4. WHEN the text contains ambiguous relationships THEN the system SHALL make reasonable assumptions and allow manual corrections

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want bidirectional synchronization between diagrams and specifications, so that changes in either format automatically update the other without losing information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user modifies a diagram element (moves, renames, adds, or deletes nodes/connections) THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding specification in real-time
2. WHEN a user edits the specification text THEN the system SHALL update the diagram to reflect the changes
3. WHEN synchronization occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain a canonical data model to ensure both outputs remain aligned
4. WHEN conflicts arise during sync THEN the system SHALL preserve user intent and provide clear feedback about any ambiguities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want AI-generated specifications with acceptance criteria and tests, so that I can quickly produce comprehensive documentation and test scaffolding for development teams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a diagram is created or updated THEN the system SHALL generate a structured Markdown specification
2. WHEN generating specifications THEN the system SHALL include acceptance criteria for each feature or workflow step
3. WHEN specifications are complete THEN the system SHALL produce runnable unit and integration test scaffolds in the user's chosen programming language
4. WHEN tests are generated THEN they SHALL be structured to validate the acceptance criteria defined in the specification

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a consultant, I want to export diagrams and specifications in multiple formats, so that I can deliver professional documentation to clients in their preferred format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests diagram export THEN the system SHALL support PNG, SVG, and PDF formats
2. WHEN a user requests specification export THEN the system SHALL support Markdown, Word, and PDF formats
3. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL maintain formatting, layout, and visual quality appropriate for professional use
4. WHEN a user wants to share work THEN the system SHALL generate a read-only public link to the project

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to integrate with external project management tools, so that I can push generated tasks directly to my team's workflow without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a specification includes actionable tasks THEN the system SHALL support pushing tasks to Jira, Trello, or Linear
2. WHEN importing from external tools THEN the system SHALL auto-generate diagrams and specifications from existing tickets
3. WHEN integrating with external tools THEN the system SHALL maintain task relationships and dependencies
4. IF integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback export options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive project management interface, so that I can organize multiple FlowSketch projects and easily navigate between them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new project THEN the system SHALL prompt for project name and description or allow pasting raw notes
2. WHEN a project is created THEN the system SHALL display an interactive diagram in the left panel and generated specification in the right panel
3. WHEN a user has multiple projects THEN the system SHALL provide a project list with search and filtering capabilities
4. WHEN working on a project THEN the system SHALL auto-save changes and maintain version history

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time editing capabilities, so that I can see immediate feedback as I make changes to either diagrams or specifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags diagram nodes THEN the system SHALL update positions in real-time with smooth animations
2. WHEN a user types in the specification panel THEN the system SHALL provide live preview of changes
3. WHEN multiple users collaborate THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent edits without data loss
4. WHEN the system is processing changes THEN it SHALL provide visual feedback about sync status
